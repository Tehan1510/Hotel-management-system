Setup & Installation

Clone or Download the repository.

Create the Resources Folder:

Inside your source folder (src), create a folder named Rescources.

Note: The code uses the specific spelling Rescources. If you change this to resources, you must update all file paths in the Java files.

Add Images:

Place your background image (rename it to a170b7e6b576d72403c665e6337322e1.jpg or update the code).

Place your logo image as logo.png.

Place your login icon (rename to b41ff478e42e31fd71584d9dae338ffa-removebg-preview.png or update the code).

Compile and Run:

Compile all .java files.

Run AdminLoginFrame as the main class.

Credentials

Username: admin

Password: temp123

Customization

Colors: Edit the GOLD_COLOR and FORM_BACKGROUND constants in any panel class to change the theme.

Images: Update the file paths in the try-catch blocks within AdminLoginFrame and AdminDashboardFrame to use your own assets.

Troubleshooting

"Background image not found": Ensure the Rescources folder is in the correct location relative to your compiled class files (classpath). In many IDEs, this folder should be under src.

UI Glitches: This app uses custom transparency. Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date. The transparency effect relies on painting
